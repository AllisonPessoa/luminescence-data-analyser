# Luminescence Data Analyzer
Pyton scripts to perform usual analysis with data from experiments in Luminescence. Originally designed for Nano-Optics experiments performed at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - Brazil.
Testing files with some spectra are attached.

## Spectra Analyzer
Analyze data from spectroscopy measurements. The data-structure is a vector with x-axis as wavelength and y-axis as intensity.

## Decay Curve Analyzer
Analyze data from time resolved measurements. The data-structure is a vector with x-axis as time and y-axis as intensity.
